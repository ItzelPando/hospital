This way we escape from uncertainty and frustration, and it will also allow us to perform our tasks more relaxed and give rise to creativity: we cannot think well if we are busy, we get blocked. We must not forget that for success at work, study and also personal, the time dedicated to clear the mind and body, as well as to sleep and eat properly, are as important as the time dedicated to the tasks themselves. It will allow us to work faster, with greater concentration and clearer ideas, and the only way to prove it is to try it.</p>
